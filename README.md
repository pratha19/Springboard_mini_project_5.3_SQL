This repo contains Springboard's SQL project questions (1520094343_sql_project) and my solutions for 
each question (Pratha_SQL_solutions_1520094343_sql_project). The project involves answering some basic questions
regarding the activities of a country club. It involves three tables-
1. Bookings-  which contains each row as a booking and the columns listed are the starttime, member id, facility id, etc.
2. Facilities- which contains the facility id, member and guest cost to use each facility, facility name, etc.
3. Members- contains details like member name, etc. for all the member ids.
